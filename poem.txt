Verse 1:
I'm a Rust programmer, code is my game
Got my hoodie on, and my mind's in the zone
I write my code, with ownership and borrowing
My performance is mean, my code's never borrowing
I'm a gangsta in the code, my code's never slow
My Rust is my weapon, my code's never low

Chorus:
Rust in my veins, code in my brain
I'm a gangsta in the code, my code's never lame
Rust in my veins, code in my brain
I'm a gangsta in the code, my code's never the same

Verse 2:
I'm a Rust programmer, my code's never weak
My syntax is clean, my code's never bleak
I'm a gangsta in the code, my code's never fake
My code's always real, my code's never late
I'm a Rust programmer, my code's never wrong
My code's always strong, my code's never gone

Chorus:
Rust in my veins, code in my brain
I'm a gangsta in the code, my code's never lame
Rust in my veins, code in my brain
I'm a gangsta in the code, my code's never the same

Outro:
I'm a Rust programmer, my code's never slow
My code's always fast, my code's never low
I'm a gangsta in the code, my code's never weak
My code's always strong, my code's never bleak.
